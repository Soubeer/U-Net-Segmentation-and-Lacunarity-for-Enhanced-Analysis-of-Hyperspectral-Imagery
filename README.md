## Abstract

Hyperspectral imaging generates rich spectral data, enabling accurate segmentation to delineate objects. This study employs a U-Net architecture for image segmentation, followed by lacunarity analysis of the Indian Pines dataset. The U-Net model, with encoder and decoder paths, performs semantic segmentation. Lacunarity, measuring spatial heterogeneity, is calculated using the variance method. Four regions of interest (ROIs) are analyzed using a gliding box technique. Results demonstrate that combining segmentation and lacunarity analysis yields nuanced insights into spatial patterns. Segmentation divides the image into discrete regions, allowing focused lacunarity investigation. Lacunarity values reveal irregularity and gaps within each ROI, highlighting differences in texture. Increasing box size initially captures more complexity as lacunarity rises, until a saturation point. The integrated approach enhances interpretation of terrain complexity, benefiting applications in remote sensing, land use, and environmental monitoring.


## Introduction

Advances in sensor technologies have allowed hyperspectral satellite imaging (HSI) to become a sophisticated technology capable of capturing a large spectrum, often more than a hundred bands of light per pixel. To accurately determine the boundaries of items within a class through HSI segmentation, a plethora of reflectance data on underlying materials is helpful. Because of this, HSI is used in a wide range of industries, including precision farming, military operations, and surveillance. Modern deep learning (DL) methods that do not require explicit feature engineering as well as traditional machine-learning techniques that are classified into supervised and unsupervised categories include the state-of-the-art HSI segmentation approaches. With the advent of deep learning (DL) techniques like deep belief networks (DBNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which enable the extraction of spectral features or a combination of spectral and spatial pixel information, a revolutionary era in hyperspectral image analysis has begun. Lack of human annotated ground-truth sets is a key barrier to the validation of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) segmentation algorithms. A limited collection of up to three HSI benchmarks is used to test nearly all segmentation techniques, with the Indian Pines photos being the most often employed. Using training (T) and testing (Ψ) sets from the same HSI dataset is a popular method. A validation subset (V) may be utilized if needed for tasks like hyper-parameter selection or deep learning training process guidance. Ψ is crucial for assessing the model's generalization. Moreover, recent studies have highlighted advancements in hyperspectral image analysis for geological mapping, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics. Additionally, reviews of deep learning applications in hyperspectral image analysis and recent advances in hyperspectral image fusion techniques have contributed to further advancements in the field.

## Background Study

Hyperspectral image segmentation, owing to its ability to capture detailed spectral information across a broad range of wavelengths, has garnered significant interest in remote sensing and image processing. Effectively extracting pertinent details from the intricate and high-dimensional data inherent in hyperspectral images, where each pixel signifies a spectrum of reflectance values, necessitates accurate segmentation. Various approaches have been employed in hyperspectral picture segmentation, ranging from sophisticated methods such as spectral unmixing and machine learning algorithms to conventional techniques like clustering and thresholding. The overarching goal of these methodologies is to partition the hyperspectral image into discrete regions representing different materials or land cover types, facilitating in-depth research and interpretation.

Lacunarity analysis becomes an important tool after hyperspectral image segmentation for describing the spatial distribution and structural variability inside the segmented regions. When used for image analysis, lacunarity measures how evenly gaps or empty spaces are distributed throughout a structure, revealing details about its texture and intricacy. Lacunarity analysis applied to hyperspectral image segments facilitates a more profound comprehension of the spatial patterns and imperfections present in various materials or land cover types. This technique can help distinguish minute differences in the makeup of the segmented regions by revealing the extent of spatial heterogeneity. Researchers and practitioners can improve their capacity to comprehend and distinguish between various land cover types by integrating lacunarity analysis with hyperspectral image segmentation. This will lead to increased classification accuracy and more sophisticated environmental monitoring applications.

## Dataset

The Indian Pines dataset is composed of sixteen separate classes, each of which represents specific spectral features related to various land cover patterns.Collected by the Indian Pines research project, the dataset comprises 145 spectral bands and covers an area in Northwestern Indiana. It includes farmland that is planted to a variety of crops, including corn, alfalfa, corn-notill, and corn-mintill. In addition, the collection contains natural land cover classes like grass-pasture and grass-trees-drift-fences, as well as areas covered by a variety of tree species, such as cottonwood and poplar. Hyperspectral imaging's comprehensive analysis and classification of land cover patterns are made possible by the Indian Pines dataset's wide range of classifications.

## Network Structure

The U-Net architecture, introduced in 2015 by Ronneberger et al. for medical image segmentation, is designed to achieve accurate localization and area delineation of objects within a class. This convolutional network features a U-shaped structure comprising two primary paths, identified as the contracting and expansive paths by the authors. These paths are commonly referred to as the encoder and decoder, respectively, constituting the key elements of the U-Net architecture. The contracting or encoder path in the U-Net architecture employs successive convolutions with a 3×3 kernel size, same padding, and stride one, incorporating Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), batch normalization, and max pooling. This process enhances the number of feature layers while concurrently reducing the image size. Notably, there are no fully connected layers in this model, rendering this segment interchangeable with any pre-trained model. Each down-sampling step in this path doubles the number of features. Conversely, the expansive or decoder path utilizes up-convolution to diminish feature count and restore the image size to the original input dimensions. To retain details, concatenated features from the contracting path are incorporated during up-sampling. This iterative process continues until the creation of a mask image and the final result.

## Methodology

A rapid evolution of image segmentation methodologies has ensued, predominantly leveraging the U-Net architecture for performance optimization. Notable enhancements have been made in diverse facets such as application range, feature augmentation, training speed, accuracy, feature fusion, small sample training sets, and generalization improvement. This section centers on the myriad variations of U-Net-based networks, commencing with an elucidation of the U-Net framework. Subsequently, a comprehensive analysis of U-Net variants unfolds through intermodality and intramodality categorizations, providing nuanced insights into associated challenges and solutions. The survey of pertinent literature is encapsulated by delving into improved performance indicators and key structural characteristics.

## Results

For various reasons, the segmentation of the Indian Pines image is crucial to the subsequent lacunarity investigation. A measure of spatial heterogeneity, or how gaps and voids are distributed throughout an image, is called lacunarity. The Indian Pines image is separated into homogeneous sections by segmentation, which enables a more focused and detailed lacunarity study inside each segmented area. This makes it possible to thoroughly examine the differences in texture and spatial patterns among various land cover classifications. The analysis provides insights into the irregularity and spatial distribution of features within each segmented region, which helps to better understand landscape heterogeneity and supports applications such as environmental monitoring, land-use planning, and precision agriculture. Moreover, we may more precisely identify particular aspects in the Indian Pines image, including crop kinds, vegetation density, or changes in land cover, by incorporating segmentation results into lacunarity analysis. This in-depth investigation of localized spatial variation makes it easier to understand landscape processes in a more complex way.

## Conclusion

To sum up, our study has shown that segmentation and lacunarity analysis work well together to extract the complex spatial dynamics from the Indian Pines dataset. We were able to divide the image into discrete parts by means of segmentation, which allowed for a targeted investigation of particular elements including vegetation, crops, and land cover. A more complex picture of the terrain was offered by the lacunarity study that followed, which shed light on the irregularities and variety within these divided zones. This integrated method has important ramifications for land-use planning, precision agriculture, and environmental monitoring in addition to improving our capacity to analyze data from remote sensing. Furthermore, a thorough investigation of texture variations is made possible by the combination of segmentation and lacunarity analysis, which helps to spot abnormalities and minute differences that could otherwise go unnoticed. The complete approach has yielded fine-grained insights that provide decision-makers with a deeper knowledge of the complexity of the landscape and its consequences for different applications.
